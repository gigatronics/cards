The pass will be deposited into the Aeroplan account up to 10 weeks after your cardholder renewal date. The pass entitles a companion to accompany Primary Cardholder for a fixed base fare, when Primary Cardholder books a published economy fare on a flight marketed and operated by Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or under the Air Canada Express brand. Passes are valid for 12 months from the date issued. The pass is valid towards a new booking only, and not valid on existing reservations. Bookings must be made directly with Air Canada, via aircanada.com, the Air Canada Mobile App, or through the Air Canada call center (“Air Canada Reservations”). Valid for one round-trip for a companion when travelling on the same itinerary and booked at the same time as Primary Cardholder. Maximum one companion pass may be used per booking. If one-way travel is booked, the full base fare will be charged, the pass will be deemed fully used and the return portion of travel is forfeited. Total pricing varies based on itinerary booked. Primary Cardholder may use the pass only once on their choice of travel (i) within Canada and continental United States (excluding Hawaii) for $99 CAD base fare (ii) to/from Hawaii, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean for $299 CAD base fare, (iii) to/from South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa for $499 CAD base fare, and (iv) to/from Asia, Australia, and New Zealand for $599 base fare. Companion will be responsible to pay all applicable taxes, fees, charges and surcharges that apply above the companion’s base fare. All travel must originate or terminate in Canada or the United States. Valid for travel at any time with no blackout periods. Also valid against the Purchase of fares on sale.

The pass may not be used with premium cabin fares, or in conjunction with Aeroplan flight rewards, Flight Pass, group travel bookings, Air Canada Vacations bookings, or any other discounts or promotion codes. The pass must be redeemed at time of Purchase, and if multiple companion passes are available for the Aeroplan number, the pass that would expire first will be used. Booking must be made before the pass expiry date; travel may occur after the pass expiry date subject to flight schedule availability at the time of booking. Pass may only be used as described, cannot be transferred and has no monetary or exchange value. Changes or cancellations are allowed according to the fare rules of the fare purchased. Changes and cancellations must be made at the same time for both guests, and failure to do so may result in a forfeit of the companion pass. If during a change or cancellation the pass is reinstated in the Primary Cardholder’s account, the original expiry date will take effect and the pass may then be considered expired. In the event of a change or cancellation, travellers are required to pay all applicable fees based on the fare type purchased for each ticket, plus the difference in fare, if applicable, and all applicable taxes, fees, charges and surcharges that apply above the base fare. Companions who are members of Aeroplan or other partner frequent flyer programs are eligible to accumulate points and/or miles for the ticket issued in exchange for the companion pass according to conditions of the fare brand purchased. Aeroplan Elite Status benefits and upgrades are applicable if the traveller holds appropriate status and the fare purchased allows. Air Canada reserves the right to apply additional fees for bookings made via Air Canada Reservations. Unused passes will automatically be cancelled on the date the credit card is closed, regardless of reason for closure, or if the credit card account is changed to a different product.

This benefit applies when the member qualified for Aeroplan Elite Status by earning the required Status Qualifying Miles or Status Qualifying Segments (\"SQS\"), as well as the required Status Qualifying Dollars (\"SQD\"), in the prior qualification year. If the member has been granted complimentary status, as determined by Air Canada, that is higher than the status they would have earned via their Status Qualifying balances, the rollover amount will be based on the status they would have earned otherwise (if any), and not the granted complimentary status. To qualify for SQM rollover, the Primary Cardholder must be approved for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card prior to December 15th of the current calendar year. SQM rolled over from the previous qualifying year will apply towards status qualification for the following qualifying year. Rollover SQM will be deposited directly into the member\\'s Aeroplan account no later than March 30 of any given year, provided the member earned at least Aeroplan 25K Status based on their Status Qualifying balances from the prior qualifying year. Rollover does not apply to SQS or SQD. Benefit is only available to Primary Cardholders and does not apply to Additional Cardholders. In the event the credit card is changed to a different product or the account is closed, regardless of reason for closure, any SQM rolled over as a result of this benefit will be removed from the Aeroplan account, and any status earned as a result of these rolled over SQM may also be rescinded. SQM do not count towards Million Mile Status and are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards. Where a Primary Cardholder is eligible to roll over SQM under another Aeroplan credit card, the total cumulative roll over of all SQM towards Aeroplan Elite Status cannot exceed the maximum of 200,000 SQM. Aeroplan Elite Status is offered by Air Canada. All Aeroplan Elite Status conditions apply and can be reviewed at\\naircanada.com/elite-termsandconditions\\n. The Toronto-Dominion Bank has no responsibility or liability for Aeroplan Elite Status.\\nSQM will cease to exist after December 31, 2025 and Status Qualifying Credits (\"SQC\") will be introduced starting January 1, 2026, with one final rollover activity in the form of a conversion Rollover SQM to SQC. Accordingly, Primary Cardholders of the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card (\"Eligible Card\") will, for the 2026 Elite Year, be eligible to have Rollover SQM from the prior qualification year converted to SQC on the basis of 5 Rollover SQM to 1 SQC (\"Converted SQC\"), up to a maximum of 40,000 Converted SQC. Other than the conversion Rollover SQM to SQC, all other Rollover SQM benefit Terms and Conditions continue to apply, including without limitation that to be eligible for the Converted SQC, the Primary Cardholder must achieve any Aeroplan Elite Status for the 2026 Elite Year in the prior qualification year (complimentary, gifted, or promotional Aeroplan Elite Status are ineligible) and be an Aeroplan Member in good standing. Converted SQC will be deposited by Air Canada into the Primary Cardholder’s Aeroplan account by March 31, 2026.

This benefit applies when the member qualified for Aeroplan Elite Status by earning the required Status Qualifying Miles or Status Qualifying Segments (&amp;quot;SQS&amp;quot;), as well as the required Status Qualifying Dollars (&amp;quot;SQD&amp;quot;), in the prior qualification year. If the member has been granted complimentary status, as determined by Air Canada, that is higher than the status they would have earned via their Status Qualifying balances, the rollover amount will be based on the status they would have earned otherwise (if any), and not the granted complimentary status. To qualify for SQM rollover, the Primary Cardholder must be approved for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card prior to December 15th of the current calendar year. SQM rolled over from the previous qualifying year will apply towards status qualification for the following qualifying year. Rollover SQM will be deposited directly into the member's Aeroplan account no later than March 30 of any given year, provided the member earned at least Aeroplan 25K Status based on their Status Qualifying balances from the prior qualifying year. Rollover does not apply to SQS or SQD. Benefit is only available to Primary Cardholders and does not apply to Additional Cardholders. In the event the credit card is changed to a different product or the account is closed, regardless of reason for closure, any SQM rolled over as a result of this benefit will be removed from the Aeroplan account, and any status earned as a result of these rolled over SQM may also be rescinded. SQM do not count towards Million Mile Status and are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards. Where a Primary Cardholder is eligible to roll over SQM under another Aeroplan credit card, the total cumulative roll over of all SQM towards Aeroplan Elite Status cannot exceed the maximum of 200,000 SQM. Aeroplan Elite Status is offered by Air Canada. All Aeroplan Elite Status conditions apply and can be reviewed at &lt;a href=\\&quot;https://aircanada.com/elite-termsandconditions\\&quot;&gt;aircanada.com/elite-termsandconditions&lt;/a&gt;.

Accordingly, Primary Cardholders of the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card (&amp;quot;Eligible Card&amp;quot;) will, for the 2026 Elite Year, be eligible to have Rollover SQM from the prior qualification year converted to SQC on the basis of 5 Rollover SQM to 1 SQC (&amp;quot;Converted SQC&amp;quot;), up to a maximum of 40,000 Converted SQC. Other than the conversion Rollover SQM to SQC, all other Rollover SQM benefit Terms and Conditions continue to apply, including without limitation that to be eligible for the Converted SQC, the Primary Cardholder must achieve any Aeroplan Elite Status for the 2026 Elite Year in the prior qualification year (complimentary, gifted, or promotional Aeroplan Elite Status are ineligible) and be an Aeroplan Member in good standing. Converted SQC will be deposited by Air Canada into the Primary Cardholder’s Aeroplan account by March 31, 2026. SQC are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards, cannot be exchanged, and do not count towards Million Mile status. In the event the Eligible Card is changed to a different product, or the Eligible Card account is closed, regardless of reason for closure, any Converted SQC deposited as a result of this benefit will be removed from the Aeroplan account, and any Aeroplan Elite Status as a result of Converted SQC may also be rescinded.

       " Primary Cardholders of the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card who also hold Aeroplan Elite Status will be able to roll over up to a maximum of 200,000 Status Qualifying Miles (\"SQM\") from the prior qualification year to the next qualification year. This benefit applies when the member qualified for Aeroplan Elite Status by earning the required Status Qualifying Miles or Status Qualifying Segments (\"SQS\"), as well as the required Status Qualifying Dollars (\"SQD\"), in the prior qualification year. If the member has been granted complimentary status, as determined by Air Canada, that is higher than the status they would have earned via their Status Qualifying balances, the rollover amount will be based on the status they would have earned otherwise (if any), and not the granted complimentary status. To qualify for SQM rollover, the Primary Cardholder must be approved for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card prior to December 15th of the current calendar year. SQM rolled over from the previous qualifying year will apply towards status qualification for the following qualifying year. Rollover SQM will be deposited directly into the member's Aeroplan account no later than March 30 of any given year, provided the member earned at least Aeroplan 25K Status based on their Status Qualifying balances from the prior qualifying year. Rollover does not apply to SQS or SQD. Benefit is only available to Primary Cardholders and does not apply to Additional Cardholders. In the event the credit card is changed to a different product or the account is closed, regardless of reason for closure, any SQM rolled over as a result of this benefit will be removed from the Aeroplan account, and any status earned as a result of these rolled over SQM may also be rescinded. SQM do not count towards Million Mile Status and are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards. Where a Primary Cardholder is eligible to roll over SQM under another Aeroplan credit card, the total cumulative roll over of all SQM towards Aeroplan Elite Status cannot exceed the maximum of 200,000 SQM.

Accordingly, Primary Cardholders of the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card (\"Eligible Card\") will, for the 2026 Elite Year, be eligible to have Rollover SQM from the prior qualification year converted to SQC on the basis of 5 Rollover SQM to 1 SQC (\"Converted SQC\"), up to a maximum of 40,000 Converted SQC. Other than the conversion Rollover SQM to SQC, all other Rollover SQM benefit Terms and Conditions continue to apply, including without limitation that to be eligible for the Converted SQC, the Primary Cardholder must achieve any Aeroplan Elite Status for the 2026 Elite Year in the prior qualification year (complimentary, gifted, or promotional Aeroplan Elite Status are ineligible) and be an Aeroplan Member in good standing. Converted SQC will be deposited by Air Canada into the Primary Cardholder’s Aeroplan account by March 31, 2026. SQC are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards, cannot be exchanged, and do not count towards Million Mile status.

       " <p>From 07/10/2024 through 06/30/2026 (“Benefit Term”), the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit (as defined below) is available to cardholders (individually, “you” or “your”) with eligible U.S. issued Visa Infinite® cards, Mexico issued Visa Infinite® cards or Canada issued Visa Infinite Privilege® cards (“Eligible Visa Cards”). Cardholders with Eligible Visa Cards must (1) visit OpenTable.com or open the OpenTable mobile app; (2) sign in to an existing OpenTable account or sign up for a free OpenTable account; (3) complete the eligibility check to verify their Eligible Visa Card; and (4) add their Eligible Visa Card to their OpenTable account to redeem the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit. The Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit includes exclusive access to primetime reservations at participating restaurants in select cities (“Participating Restaurants”) offered by OpenTable through the OpenTable platform which includes, without limitation, OpenTable’s website, mobile app, and the Benefit page during the Benefit Term (“Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit” or “Benefit”). Participating Restaurant inventory that is not booked prior to reservation day/time may be released to general OpenTable inventory.</p>\n",
       " <p>Certain Participating Restaurants may require credit card information to make a reservation and/or pre-pay for all or a portion of the dining experience. In such instances, the Eligible Visa Card stored in your OpenTable account must be used. If an Eligible Visa Card is no longer stored in your OpenTable account, you may be required to successfully complete an additional eligibility verification of an Eligible Visa Card. If your card is ineligible at the time of the eligibility check, OpenTable may store your card in your account for future eligibility purposes and for general use on the OpenTable platform, subject to the OpenTable Terms of Use and OpenTable Privacy Policy. OpenTable will conduct an eligibility check immediately upon card verification, followed by a subsequent eligibility check once every 24 hours when the user visits OpenTable properties. If your previously ineligible card becomes eligible, OpenTable will grant you access to the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit and notify you of such. You must go through the verification flow to receive eligibility status notification. OpenTable and Visa shall have no further responsibility for your dining experience, including your experience at a Participating Restaurant.</p>\n",
       " <p>The Benefit is subject to modification or cancellation without notice, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, OpenTable may update or amend these terms from time to time at its discretion. The Benefit is subject to all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations. Void where prohibited. Cardholders with Eligible Visa Cards are also subject to the OpenTable Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. OpenTable shall not be obligated to honor the Benefit for any cardholder that is unable to validate their card’s eligibility or violates OpenTable policies.</p>\n",
