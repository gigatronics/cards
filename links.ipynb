Aeroplan reserves the right, at any time and at its sole discretion, to reverse, revoke or rescind SQC, Elite Status and associated benefits in the event of misuse of this benefit.

This benefit applies when the member qualified for Aeroplan Elite Status by earning the required Status Qualifying Miles or Status Qualifying Segments (\"SQS\"), as well as the required Status Qualifying Dollars (\"SQD\"), in the prior qualification year. If the member has been granted complimentary status, as determined by Air Canada, that is higher than the status they would have earned via their Status Qualifying balances, the rollover amount will be based on the status they would have earned otherwise (if any), and not the granted complimentary status. To qualify for SQM rollover, the Primary Cardholder must be approved for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card prior to December 15th of the current calendar year. SQM rolled over from the previous qualifying year will apply towards status qualification for the following qualifying year. Rollover SQM will be deposited directly into the member\\'s Aeroplan account no later than March 30 of any given year, provided the member earned at least Aeroplan 25K Status based on their Status Qualifying balances from the prior qualifying year. Rollover does not apply to SQS or SQD. Benefit is only available to Primary Cardholders and does not apply to Additional Cardholders. In the event the credit card is changed to a different product or the account is closed, regardless of reason for closure, any SQM rolled over as a result of this benefit will be removed from the Aeroplan account, and any status earned as a result of these rolled over SQM may also be rescinded. SQM do not count towards Million Mile Status and are not redeemable towards Aeroplan rewards. Where a Primary Cardholder is eligible to roll over SQM under another Aeroplan credit card, the total cumulative roll over of all SQM towards Aeroplan Elite Status cannot exceed the maximum of 200,000 SQM. Aeroplan Elite Status is offered by Air Canada. All Aeroplan Elite Status conditions apply and can be reviewed at aircanada.com/elite-termsandconditions .

SQM will cease to exist after December 31, 2025 and Status Qualifying Credits (\"SQC\") will be introduced starting January 1, 2026, with one final rollover activity in the form of a conversion Rollover SQM to SQC. Accordingly, Primary Cardholders of the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card (\"Eligible Card\") will, for the 2026 Elite Year, be eligible to have Rollover SQM from the prior qualification year converted to SQC on the basis of 5 Rollover SQM to 1 SQC (\"Converted SQC\"), up to a maximum of 40,000 Converted SQC. Other than the conversion Rollover SQM to SQC, all other Rollover SQM benefit Terms and Conditions continue to apply, including without limitation that to be eligible for the Converted SQC, the Primary Cardholder must achieve any Aeroplan Elite Status for the 2026 Elite Year in the prior qualification year (complimentary, gifted, or promotional Aeroplan Elite Status are ineligible) and be an Aeroplan Member in good standing.

If the member has been granted complimentary status, as determined by Air Canada, that is higher than the status they would have earned via their Status Qualifying balances, the rollover amount will be based on the status they would have earned otherwise (if any), and not the granted complimentary status. To qualify for SQM rollover, the Primary Cardholder must be approved for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Privilege card prior to December 15th of the current calendar year.

For travel in high-demand periods, the amount of Aeroplan points required for this destination might be higher. Subject to availability. Due to travel restrictions, government recommendations and passenger demand, available destinations may vary. Points value does not include taxes and third-party charges which may apply. For flight rewards with a partner airline, a partner booking fee will apply. For full details please visit Aeroplan Program Terms and Conditions.\\n40\\nYour points will not expire provided that you are the Primary Cardholder of a TD Aeroplan credit card and your Aeroplan account is in good standing under the Aeroplan Terms and conditions (\\naircanada.com/aeroplan-termsandconditions\\n).\\nFor more information about the Aeroplan Expiry policy please visit\\naircanada.com/aeroplan-inactivitypolicy\\n.\\n41\\nTop-up or Extension coverage is provided by the TD Travel Medical Insurance Single Trip Plan (Single Trip Plan) and/or TD Trip Cancellation and Trip Interruption Insurance. The Single Trip Plan is underwritten by TD Life Insurance Company. TD Trip Cancellation and Trip Interruption Insurance is underwritten by TD Life Insurance Company (medical covered causes) and TD Home and Auto Insurance Company (non-medical covered causes). Top-up or Extension coverage from TD may offer different benefits with different terms and conditions than your existing coverage included with your TD Credit Card. Coverages and benefits are subject to eligibility conditions, limitations, and exclusions, including pre-existing medical condition exclusions.\\n#\\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank is not responsible for this benefit.\\nFrom 07/10/2024 through 06/30/2026 (“Benefit Term”), the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit (as defined below) is available to cardholders (individually, “you” or “your”) with eligible U.S. issued Visa Infinite® cards, Mexico issued Visa Infinite® cards or Canada issued Visa Infinite Privilege® cards (“Eligible Visa Cards”). Cardholders with Eligible Visa Cards must (1) visit OpenTable.com or open the OpenTable mobile app; (2) sign in to an existing OpenTable account or sign up for a free OpenTable account; (3) complete the eligibility check to verify their Eligible Visa Card; and (4) add their Eligible Visa Card to their OpenTable account to redeem the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit. The Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit includes exclusive access to primetime reservations at participating restaurants in select cities (“Participating Restaurants”) offered by OpenTable through the OpenTable platform which includes, without limitation, OpenTable’s website, mobile app, and the Benefit page during the Benefit Term (“Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit” or “Benefit”). Participating Restaurant inventory that is not booked prior to reservation day/time may be released to general OpenTable inventory.\\nCertain Participating Restaurants may require credit card information to make a reservation and/or pre-pay for all or a portion of the dining experience. In such instances, the Eligible Visa Card stored in your OpenTable account must be used. If an Eligible Visa Card is no longer stored in your OpenTable account, you may be required to successfully complete an additional eligibility verification of an Eligible Visa Card. If your card is ineligible at the time of the eligibility check, OpenTable may store your card in your account for future eligibility purposes and for general use on the OpenTable platform, subject to the OpenTable Terms of Use and OpenTable Privacy Policy. OpenTable will conduct an eligibility check immediately upon card verification, followed by a subsequent eligibility check once every 24 hours when the user visits OpenTable properties. If your previously ineligible card becomes eligible, OpenTable will grant you access to the Visa Dining Collection OpenTable Benefit and notify you of such. You must go through the verification flow to receive eligibility status notification. OpenTable and Visa shall have no further responsibility for your dining experience, including your experience at a Participating Restaurant.\\nThe Benefit is subject to modification or cancellation without notice, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, OpenTable may update or amend these terms from time to time at its discretion. The Benefit is subject to all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations. Void where prohibited. Cardholders with Eligible Visa Cards are also subject to the OpenTable Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. OpenTable shall not be obligated to honor the Benefit for any cardholder that is unable to validate their card’s eligibility or violates OpenTable policies.\\n#1\\nAs awarded on October 28, 2024, by votes cast in the RewardsCanada.ca Canada’s Choice awards.
